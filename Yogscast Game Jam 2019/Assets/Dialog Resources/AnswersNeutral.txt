Just a candy wrapper.
Duuuuuude… It was basically an entire dumpster!
There was a trash can a few feet away from it.
I drove all the way to the person’s house and handed it to them personally and watched as they threw it away!
They said it was alright, standard stuff.
They told me the most amazing story about home some rich billionaire made a truck that was indestructible. Totally believable...
It was my coworker, Karen!
I asked the Vice-President, of course! Who else?
Dirty Charlie’s. It’s an Italian place downtown.
It was at a five star hotel with strippers for waitresses!
I just ordered the spaghetti. Simple stuff.
They served a full course of shrimp topped with flamed tequila shots!
They said thank you and went on their way.
They gave me the keys to their mansion as a thank you!
I said that I liked their shoes.
I told them that their tie was crooked. Totally a rookie mistake. A catwalk model like me should know.
His name was Charlie, I met him in high school.
None other than the Queen of England, duuude...
I helped him move houses.
I helped her conquer this little tiny country that no one knows about, not even you!
